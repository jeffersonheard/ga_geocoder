# Geoanalytics django app packaging script.  This should be pretty universal.
# If you can't follow these conventions, be really sensible about what you're
# doing.  This script picks up any items in the web/ directory and puts it in
# GEOANALYTICS_ROOT/geoanalytics-web.  It furthermore picks up any items in the
# bin/ directory and puts them in GEOANALYTICS_ROOT/geoanalytics-bin, and it
# finally puts all fixtures/ items in GEOANALYTICS_ROOT/geoanalytics-fixtures
# (these still have to be run upon being installed, although we might take care
# of that in the future).  In addition, all non python files within the source
# trees listed in "packages". Simply specify all the relevant parameters here
# and they'll be propagated down as long as you're following my directory
# conventions.  Also, be sure that the template loader in django knows how to
# get to app-level templates.  You might need to add the egg loader if you
# haven't already.
